# Bulk Solana Wallet Generator

Node.js script that generates a specified number of Solana addresses and private keys and saves them to a file.

## Installation
To use this script, you will need to have Node.js installed on your system. Once you have Node.js installed, clone this repository and navigate to the project directory. Then, run the following command to install the required dependencies:

``` npm install ```

### Prerequisites

This script requires the Node.js modules.
You can install these modules by running the following command in your terminal:

``` npm install coinkey crypto fs readline @solana/web3.js ```

## Usage
To generate wallets, run the script using the following command:

``` node app.js ```

The script will prompt you for the number of wallets you want to generate. Enter the desired number and press enter. The script will then generate the specified number of wallets and save them to a file called generated.txt in the project directory.

Each generated wallet will have a private key and a public address. The private key should be kept secret as it allows access to the funds in the wallet. The public address can be shared and is used to receive funds.
